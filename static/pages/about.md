# Hey there! 👋
<div style="color: white;font-size: 18px;">
I'm <b>Ayon</b> – a code wizard in training and airplane nerd who's probably debugging something right now! 🚀
</div>

## What's My Deal? 💭
<div style="color:brown">
Currently based in Tomsk, I'm pursuing Computer Science & DevOps Engineering at TSU. Originally from the vibrant city of Kolkata, India.

## My Not-So-Secret Obsession ✈️
<div style="color:chocolate;">
When I'm not pushing code to Git, you'll find me:
<br><br>

- 🛠️ Building RC model planes
- 📊 Geeking out over aircraft specs
- 🎧 Listening to music
- 📚 Reading dystopian novels
</div>

## The Code Life 💻


<div style="display: inline-block; width: 65%; margin-left: 20px; color:lightgray;">

I've had the opportunity to contribute to diverse and impactful projects across multiple organizations through my internships. At _Alfalgo_, I focused on developing real-time market systems and integrating machine learning models into production environments. As a software development intern at _Intellify_, I worked extensively with scalable API architectures and database optimization for ML applications. At _WorldInteria, I contributed to the development of REST APIs and analytics dashboard solutions, while at Smilecure Lifestyle, I implemented comprehensive booking system solutions. I particularly enjoy tackling complex technical challenges, whether it's optimizing system performance, implementing containerization solutions, or developing automated workflows. My passion lies in creating robust, scalable systems that deliver tangible business value while maintaining high standards of code quality and system reliability.

## When I'm Not in VS Code 🎵
<div style="color:#72f1b8">
Music is my coding fuel! ⛽ I firmly believe that the best debugging sessions happen with the perfect playlist. Also, you'll often find me tinkering with electronics – because apparently, I didn't get enough of that with software alone! 🔧
</div>

## Currently... 🎯
<div style="color:orange">

  - **📚 Learning** : Whatever shiny new tech caught my attention this week
  - **🛠️ Building**: Probably another RC plane control system
  - **🎧 Listening to** : My debugging playlist
  - **💭 Dreaming about** : Becoming a billionaire LoL
</div>

## The Infrastructure Guy 🏗️
<div style="color:cadetblue;">
I get weirdly excited about infrastructure – that keeps our code running. DevOps, cloud architecture, you name it – if it's about building and connecting stuff, I'm probably interested!
</div>

## Let's Connect! 🌐
<div style="color:#848bbd">
Got a cool project idea? Want to talk about planes? Need someone to geek out with about that new tech stack? Hit me up! I'm always down to collaborate or just chat about aviation, tech, or why Python is actually named after a comedy group and not a snake! 🐍

Remember: Life is too short for bad code and missed plane spotting opportunities! ✈️

PS: Yes, my **GitHub** username is <a href="https://github.com/FakeCoder01" target="_blank">_FakeCoder01_</a>, but I promise I write real code... most of the time! 😉
